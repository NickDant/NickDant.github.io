#### What did I do this past week?

This past week was quite busy. I had a test in software design that required studying design patterns so that combined with working on phase 2 of the project took some time.

#### What's in my way?

My group would like to finish strong for the last phase of the project so getting a head start will be very beneficial. It will also help to spread the work out more evenly over the next two weeks compared to waiting to the last minute and rushing to make sure everything is working.

#### What will I do next week?

This upcoming week I will work with my team to start the third phase of project. We will have to brainstorm ideas for the data visualization and get search working so, again, I'd like to start early on this.

#### What's my experience of the class?

The lectures have been pretty interesting, although I've already been taught some basic SQL so much of what we have done so far has been review. On the other hand, it has been some time since I've actually used SQL so it'll be a good refresher, especially on joins. I am also interested in how my group will visualize another group's project.

#### Tip-of-the-week

[CodePen](http://codepen.io/) is a useful way to test front end web design.
