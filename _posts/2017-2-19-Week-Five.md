#### What did I do this past week?

My partner and I finished the Netflix project in a reasonable amount of time. Having enough time to ensure everything is in the proper format for submission is nice and starting early definitely pays off.

#### What's in my way?

I would like to finish all of the readings early this week so that I have plenty of time to focus on my software design test. My partner and I are also working on finding some more partners to make a group for the next project.

#### What will I do next week?

Now that the Netflix project is finished, I will have plenty of time to get ahead on the readings. I want to make sure I'm understanding the content as it seems like useful information that we will need going forward in this class.

#### What's my experience of the class?

I am interested to learn more about what the next project is. It has been a while since I've worked in a large group setting for school. I'm also looking forward to learning the other tools this course covers. I'm also finishing the quizzes faster but still making silly mistakes sometimes.

#### Tip-of-the-week

If you use [Atom](https://atom.io/) for working on your blog posts, you can get a [wordcount package](https://atom.io/packages/wordcount) to help you ensure you are reaching your 250 word minimum. The [packages](https://atom.io/packages) for Atom in general are really convenient for finding helpful customizations to use in the editor. Also, you can make your own!
