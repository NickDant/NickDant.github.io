#### What did I do this past week?

This past week was not as busy as previous ones, surprisingly. As such, I had some time to wrap things up before going on Spring Break so now I feel pretty good about getting some stuff done over the break and when we come back. Also, our group decided on a topic so now we can move forward with the project.

#### What's in my way?

My group will need to coordinate to get some things accomplished for the first phase of the project, especially since we have a week off for the break. I think it would be beneficial if we divided up some of the work based on our strengths.

#### What will I do next week?

Outside of doing some SXSW events, I will work with my group to get some work done on the first portion of the project. I will also focus on getting ahead in some other classes if possible.

#### What's my experience of the class?

I am interested to see how the content/pace of the course changes as we get to new material. It seems as though we are wrapping up the python lectures so I'm excited to get to some new material. I am looking forward particularly to content about Javascript and SQL as it seems really beneficial to our upcoming projects and I am interested in learning more about these in general.

#### Tip-of-the-week

Flask has its own [API](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/api/#api) so you could do some meta-programming or other interesting things involving Flask.
