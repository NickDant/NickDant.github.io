#### What did I do this past week?
I have started work on Project 2. I think the project itself if very interesting as I enjoy working with relatively large amounts of data. I hope to take what I've learned from Project 1 in terms of pacing and best practices and apply them to the this one in order to stay on task. It would be very beneficial for me to make as much progress an possible early so I can verify my work is complete and functional when I need to turn it in.

#### What's in my way?
Many of my assignment deadlines and test dates are beginning to overlap so I need to stay on top of things to manage it all. With tests and other projects coming up this week, it would be great to iron out any significant issues for the project. I think I may have an issue with the total running time of my program so I want to address that sooner rather than later. Other than that, there are some small things in C++ that I need to get more practice with for me to be comfortable.

#### What will I do next week?
I need to keep up with the readings and finish project 2. I plan on setting a large amount of time aside every evening this week to dedicate time to the project so I don't run into any last minute issues.

#### Tip-of-the-week
Reading blogs written by those who work in a field of your interest is a great way to get new ideas for things to work on and learn more about how others are applying their knowledge for work and fun. For example, if you are interested in data science you could follow [Randy Olson](http://www.randalolson.com/blog/).
