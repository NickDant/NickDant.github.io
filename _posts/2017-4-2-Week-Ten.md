#### What did I do this past week?

I had a good bit of work to do in other classes so that took up a majority of my time this past week. During my downtime, I was able to create a new page for our technical report as previously it was just slapped onto our about page.

#### What's in my way?

With the deadline for phase 2 of the IDB project quickly approaching, I will have to coordinate with my team to ensure we get everything done. There are some design choices we've made involving the handling of our data grids so this will need to be handled sooner rather than later. I also have a big test this week in another class so I will have to balance that as well.

#### What will I do next week?

This upcoming week I will work with my team to complete the second phase of the class project. We did pretty well on the first phase and we were able to complete that on time so I hope that success carries over to this phase. We have made some progress on the backend but there is more to do regarding our templates.

#### What's my experience of the class?

This past week, I attended a talk by Atlassian. They discussed their products and technology but what really caught my attention was their discussion of company culture. They stressed the importance of teamwork and how that affects their day-to-day life and I thought it was valuable insight. After using their products for work for the past two summers, I can clearly see the benefit of having a well composed team that is constantly on the same page. I used to think that working by myself was the best approach but after working in a team setting it's hard to justify working by myself.

#### Tip-of-the-week

For those working with React on their project's frontend, you may find [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en - ) useful. It's an extension for Google Chrome that adds React debugging tools you may find useful.
