#### What did I do this past week?
This past week I worked on finishing up Project 1. I really enjoyed the first project as I got to get my first taste of C++ along with some really interesting development tools. I appreciate the approach that Downing wants for the projects as well. I find the structure and progress during work on a project to be very rewarding. Implementing a small change, testing it, and then integrating the change was a great approach the project and will be very helpful moving forward when we encounter more challenging tasks.

#### What's in my way?
Assignments are starting to pile up so I need to allocate time more efficiently to coordinate all of them. I did exactly what I told myself not to do at the beginning of the semester and started pretty late on Project 1. Everything worked out okay but if I ran into any really major problems I would have been in trouble. Now I realize why Downing suggests to start early. It's really beneficial to make progress/break things early on so I can take the time to get any questions addressed if need be.

#### What will I do next week?
I would like to stay on top of the readings and get a good head start on Project 2. Also, I want to spend more time programming in C++ to make my life easier in the upcoming projects and for the class in general.

#### Tip-of-the-week
[SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) is a nice git client that offers an interesting and helpful way to visualize your git status for repositories. This was really helpful when I started using version control.
