#### Class Experience

I think that I've gotten a lot out of this class. Everything from the quizzes, tests, readings, and projects helped me become more familiar with software engineering. The quizzes made sure that I was keeping up with all of the content in the course (and it forced me to get to class on time). The tests were a bit tricky but I believe they were fair. The readings took me a while but they have valuable information and topics that are extremely relevant to software engineering so it was import to not blow them off. The projects are what I enjoyed most about this class though. They exposed me to interesting tools that I didn't have a lot of experience in so I am glad I got to try them out. I've never been involved with building a site from scratch before so this experience was quite valuable. Professor Downing was an enthusiastic instructor and I am glad I had to opportunity to take this class with him. He does a tremendous job at teaching the content and course is structured very well.
