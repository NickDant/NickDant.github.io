#### What did I do this past week?
Now that classes are gearing back up, I am beginning to work on the first of many homework assignments for my classes. Progress in underway for the first OOP project; I have my environment set up correctly and I am now working on the implementation of the cache. The actual OOP classes themselves have been interesting as I feel as though I come away learning quite a bit from lecture. We also get good ideas for implementing in the project itself so that's nice. The quizzes can be a little tricky but staying up-to-date with the quizzes and reviewing lecture materials are helpful for getting prepared.

#### What's in my way?
I need to balance full-time work search with schoolwork. If I can stay proactive with the projects in OOP, I should be able to get the help I need whenever I run into any obstacles (I will definitely be running into quite a few obstacles). As a result, I should have time to set aside for work opportunities, especially with the career fair coming up. I will start getting more assignments to work on in my other classes so now is the time to try and get ahead.

#### What will I do next week?
I will be putting the finishing touches on the first project, specifically for the optimizations and the git deliverable.

#### Tip-of-the-week
[Nitrous](https://www.nitrous.io/) is a really cool cloud IDE that features numerous development templates and live collaboration. It also has integration with [Atom](https://atom.io/).
