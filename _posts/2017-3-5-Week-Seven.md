#### What did I do this past week?

I spent most of time studying for the test in this class. I am glad I started relatively early as I tend to procrastinate, especially when it comes to studying for tests.  

#### What's in my way?

My group needs to solidify our proposal for the upcoming project. We have some good ideas so far but need to pin down how we are going to represent our models and make sure they are fleshed out enough. I also have another test coming up this week so I need to balance time spent studying for that as well.

#### What will I do next week?

I will work with my team to complete our project proposal. I am pretty excited about the upcoming project as I get a chance to work with some interesting technologies that I haven't been exposed fully to so I think this will be a good learning experience.

#### What's my experience of the class?

The test was not what I had expected to be. I was thinking there would be a few implementation questions as those were the types of exercises we did in class. I had no problem with the multiple choice, however. Some parts were tricky but I think it was a fair test. Also, getting feedback immediately after completing the test was nice.

#### Tip-of-the-week

[yUML](https://yuml.me/) is a simple, online tool for creating UML diagrams. The rendering can get a little funky if you have a lot of classes and associations but overall it is a nice tool.
