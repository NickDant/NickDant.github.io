#### What did I do this past week?

This past week I spent most of my time getting caught up with school. I didn't have a lot of time over spring break to contribute to the first phase of the project so I also devoted most of my time to that. I've been working with the front end for the project so I feel as thought I am getting a better grasp on JavaScript, particularly React.

#### What's in my way?

I have a couple other group projects that I need to divide my time up between so it will be tricky finding the right balance. I want to dedicate enough time for phase two of this project as I don't want it to come down to the last minute. Furthermore, I will need to work together with my team to figure out how we will approach this second phase.

#### What will I do next week?

I plan on getting a head start on the second phase of the project. I will need to iron out some issues in our current front end related to styling. Also, we need to figure out how to integrate grid cells and sorting/filtering so that will take some time.

#### What's my experience of the class?

I enjoyed completing the first phase of the project. I think that I learned quite a bit and my team was able to work together to create a deliverable from scratch in a limited time so that was pretty satisfying. I am interested to see how the next phases of the project will build upon itself.

#### Tip-of-the-week

Mozilla has detailed [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) available that is useful to leverage for the type of work we are doing.
