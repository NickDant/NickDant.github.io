#### What did I do this past week?

This past week was not as busy as previous weeks. Actually, it was quite difficult staying motivated to do work with such an empty week. However, I did my best to keep up with the readings for this class and work with my group for how we will be approaching the last phase of the project.

#### What's in my way?

The phase 3 deadline is fast approaching and my group has some work still to do. The search will likely take some time to fully implement so it would be great if we can wrap that up well before the deadline.

#### What will I do next week?

I will work with my group to flesh out the site-wide search feature along with some other front end changes. I also need to balance my time between two other group projects so I will need to manage my time wisely.

#### What's my experience of the class?

I am looking forward to the self critique part of the website as it is a good chance to take a step back and examine what we have done so far and where we are headed for our site. I've always been interested with how websites are designed to optimize user experience and I'm glad we will have the chance to get involved with user experience.

The content we are covering in lectures also complements what I'm learning in software design so that is a welcome change to the course content.

#### Tip-of-the-week

The [D3 wiki](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki) has a lot of useful information for the visualization process of this phase, including tutorials and examples!
