#### What did I do this past week?

Other than finishing up the readings for this class, I did not have much to do regarding SWE. I worked with my team to put the final touches on the site presentation and we presented on Friday. I think the presentation went well and putting it together gave us the opportunity to step back and review what we did well and what we did not. This is valuable insight and I look forward to the critique from other groups.

#### What's in my way?

I will be focusing much of my time on studying for the upcoming exam. I am quite rusty on SQL joins so I want to make sure I review. If the second test is like the first, it could be tricky so I want to keep the format of the first exam in mind when studying for the upcoming one.

#### What will I do next week?

The last week of class is here so I will work on finishing up any last assignments and tests. I have 3 exams coming up this week so I will definitely have to put some time into studying.

#### What's my experience of the class?

Now that the project is done I feel pretty relieved. It was a good bit of work but I'm glad I had the opportunity to do it. It was valuable experience working with some new technologies and working in a team environment is always beneficial.

#### Tip-of-the-week

This may be a bit late but my team leverage [GitHub's API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) for statistics on our about page. It's a well documented API so if you think you could use this in the future check it out!
