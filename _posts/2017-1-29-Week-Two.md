#### What did I do this past week?

I have finished setting up my work environment and have started work on the Collatz project.

#### What's in my way?

Progress is good so far on the Collatz project but I would like to finish it up soon in case I run into any problems. Other than that, I need to keep preparing for the quizzes by refreshing on the current material. All of my classes have started assigning work so I need to maintain a healthy balance of course work to make sure that I stay on top of everything.

#### What will I do next week?

I plan on completing this week's assigned readings and finishing the Collatz project. If I run into any issues on the project, I will be heading to office hours to make sure I get them resolved.

#### What's my experience of the class?

The tools I've been introduced to so far are really interesting and it's nice to be able to get some more experience with them in these projects. I am also getting more familiar with the course structure in terms of lectures and quizzes and know more of what to expect. The readings for this class are fairly interesting and seem to be quite relevant to the course material as well.

#### Tip-of-the-week

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is a really interesting text editor that has a lot of customization options and support from the open source community.
