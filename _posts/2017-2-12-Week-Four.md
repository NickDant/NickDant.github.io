#### What did I do this past week?

Work has started on the Netflix project. My partner and I haven't run into any major issues (yet) so things are going pretty well.

#### What's in my way?

I would like to get Netflix finished early in the week that way we aren't rushed towards the deadline. If progress remains steady I think it should be possible. Also, I need to get better at taking the Canvas quizzes. Twice I have received a popup window saying "10 seconds left on the quiz, need to submit your answer" or something similar and I clicked "Thats fine" or "OK" and it finished the quiz before I could submit my answer. Pretty silly but I just need to be a bit quicker.

#### What will I do next week?

I will work on finishing the Netflix project and complete the readings. Completing the readings before the week starts would be nice.

#### What's my experience of the class?

I am enjoying the projects in the class so far. I think they are interesting and going through the process of completing them helps me understand the various components and tools much better. Also, I think I am getting the hang of the quizzes. It helps to review previous material from the last one or two classes. This combined with doing the readings usually prepares me enough for the quizzes.

#### Tip-of-the-week

[Conda](https://conda.io/docs/) is a useful package and environment manager that can be used to set up different versions of python to work in. For example, you could have an environment with python 3.5 for this class but also have an environment with python 2.7 for another class or personal use. You can easily change your version with a single command. Also, it's open source!
