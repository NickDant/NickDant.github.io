#### What did I do this past week?

It has been a fairly busy week as my classes all had things due towards the end of the week. However, Collatz is now finished and I feel much more comfortable with the workflow.

#### What's in my way?

I have been pretty good about starting my work well in advance of the deadline for this semester so far but I think I will have to keep starting even earlier as I tend to run into smaller problems that end up taking a disproportionate amount of time to resolve and I'd like to avoid that if possible.

#### What will I do next week?

I have found a partner for the next project so I plan on reading the spec for Netflix and getting a good head start. Other than that, I will keep up with the assigned readings.

#### What's my experience of the class?

I like having a workflow to guide me through some steps of completing a project. It keeps me on track as I can reference it any time to gauge where I am in terms of progress. However, when the workflow changes, as it did recently, it can become a little bit confusing when we've been approaching a project one way but find out there may be a better way of approaching it. I'm glad that the workflow is getting changed for the better though.


#### Tip-of-the-week

[SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) is a cool tool to help visualize your git status for various branches and repositories. It certainly isn't necessary but it's an alternative or supplement to using command line git.
