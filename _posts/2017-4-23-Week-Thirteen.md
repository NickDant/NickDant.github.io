#### What did I do this past week?

I worked with my team to implement search and put the final touches on our site. Luckily, we were able to get search resolved rather quickly and early in the week so we didn't have to worry about being pressed for time later in the week. I found the visualization portion pretty interesting although I wasn't working with particularly good data.

#### What's in my way?

I want to finish strong on the quizzes so I want to make sure I get the readings done before the week starts. Furthermore, I need to start reviewing the material for the upcoming test. I feel as though the next test is going to be harder than the first so I definitely need to focus on studying.

#### What will I do next week?

I need to figure out the best way to approach the next test. I feel as thought there is quite a bit of material that I need to touch up on so I don't want to put it off (as I usually do).

#### What's my experience of the class?

Our discussions in lecture have been reinforcing what I've been learning in software design this semester. I am glad I have had the opportunity to take both at once because I feel like they go hand-in-hand. It's useful seeing Professor Downing refactor the programs over the past few lectures as I have been able to get a better grasp on some design patterns and how they are implemented.

#### Tip-of-the-week

I found [this site](http://www.sql-join.com/sql-join-types/) to be a good source of information, visuals, and examples for various SQL joins if you are having trouble with those.
